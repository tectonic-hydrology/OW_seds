**Abstract**
The chemical evolution and habitability of ocean worlds is likely to depend on the exchange of solutes and heat between its silicate interior and liquid water ocean. On Earth, such coupled exchanges are mediated by the presence and distributions of low-permeability sediments. Here, we apply impactor models to estimate 10-40 m of exogenous sediment on ten ocean worlds assuming transport through the ice shell. For oceans with no deepwater currents, we calculate settling times through the ocean water column that are slow. For oceans with currents of the velocities predicted from independent studies silt to sand-sized grains of material delivered to the top of the ocean could remain suspended in the ocean indefinitely. Our estimates indicate that even thin layers of sediment on ocean worlds are sufficient to cause thermal and chemical isolation of silicate interiors, restricting exchange to more focused sites of hydrothermal discharge and, consequently, slowing the geochemical evolution of their oceans.
